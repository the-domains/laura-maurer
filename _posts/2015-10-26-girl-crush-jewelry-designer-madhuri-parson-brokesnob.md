description: "I met jewelry designer Madhuri Parson about a year and a half ago at a Flora Nuit event where the hostess had us featuring our lingerie and Madhuri showing her stunning collection. Lingerie and jewelry - pretty good pairing, right? I swooned over all of Madhuri's pieces and (obviously) started following her on Instagram."
